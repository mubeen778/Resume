    <br>
    <p>Angel Falls (Spanish: Salto Ángel; Pemon: Kerepakupai Merú or Parakupá Vená) is a waterfall in Venezuela. It is the world's tallest uninterrupted waterfall, with a height of 979 metres (3,212 ft), and a plunge of 807 m (2,648 ft). The waterfall drops over the edge of the Auyán-tepui mountain in the Canaima National Park (Spanish: Parque Nacional Canaima), a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Gran Sabana region of Bolívar State. The height figure, 979 m (3,212 ft), mostly consists of the main plunge but also includes about 400 metres (1,300 ft) of sloped cascade and rapids below the drop and a 30-metre-high (100 ft) plunge downstream of the talus rapids.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Tugela Falls (uThukela in Zulu[citation needed]) is a complex of seasonal waterfalls located in the Drakensberg (Dragon's Mountains) of Royal Natal National Park in KwaZulu-Natal Province, Republic of South Africa. According to some measurements, it is the world's tallest waterfall. A revisited validation of waterfall measurements is not available, and there's still uncertainty whether Tugela or Venezuela's Angel Falls is the tallest (both measurements were taken at considerable distance from the two waterfalls).[1]</p>
    
<h2>Molokai Waterfall</h2>

<br>
<p>waterfall located in the north-eastern part of Hawaiian Island of Molokai, and is unofficially cited as the fourth highest waterfall in the world,[1] and the highest in the United States.

    The falls occur where a short, seasonal stream spills over the edge of one of the tallest sea-side cliffs of the world, located between the Pelekunu and Wailau valleys. They have eroded a groove in the cliff-face and can be observed only from the ocean or air</p>
<br>
<h2>Yumbilla Waterfall</h2>
<br>

<br>
<p>Yumbilla Falls is a waterfall located near the town of Cuispes, in the northern Peruvian region of Amazonas. It is considered the world's fifth tallest waterfall, becoming internationally known since late 2007 due to a geographical survey conducted by the Geographical Institute of Peru (IGN)</p>
<br>
<h2>Vinnufossen Waterfall</h2>

<br>
<p>Vinnufossen or Vinnufallet is one of the tallest waterfalls in Europe and the eighth-tallest in the world. The 845 m (2,772 ft) tall tiered horsetail waterfall is located just east of the village of Sunndalsøra in the municipality of Sunndal in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. The falls are part of the Vinnu river which flows down from the Vinnufjellet mountain and it is fed from the Vinnufonna glacier. The falls flow into the Driva river near the village of Hoelsand</p>
